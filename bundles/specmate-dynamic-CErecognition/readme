Dynamic Cause-Effect-Recognition
==============================================================

This package has been developed by Julian Frattini at the TUM
in the Master's Thesis "Interactive Learning of Cause-Effect-
Patterns" supervised by Dr. Maximilian Junker.

==============================================================
Quickstart
==============================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------
Integration into specmate
--------------------------------------------------------------

The dynamic cause-effect-recognition (cerec) can be used in
the code of specmate by adding an Object implementing the 
interface ICauseEffectRecognition to your code.
A cerec has two main methods for interaction:
 - train: takes a CausalityExample and generates a new pattern
 	from it
 - getCEG: attempts to generate the cause-effect-graph from
 	a sentence, if its pattern is already known
Use the training method to add new patterns to the system and
use the testing method to automatically generate cause-effect-
graphs of known sentence patterns.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Standalone
--------------------------------------------------------------

The cerec can be used independently with the interface
provided by CERecognitionRestService. The following REST-
operations are supported under 
http://localhost:8080/services/rest/test-data/cerec:
 - POST : 
  - query parameters "sentence", "cause", "effect":
  	Will trigger a training operation in the system. The
  	fields "cause" and "effect" may be left empty to train
  	a non-causal sentence
 - GET : 
  - query parameters (none): Returns a list of all created
  	patterns. Useful for development purposes
  - query parameters "sentence": Will trigger a getCEG/test
  	operation in the system and attempt to generate a
  	cause-effect-graph from the given sentence

--------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------

The algorithm can be previously trained when the cerec is 
initiated by providing training data from the start. For this
create training data files (currently only .json is supported)
and add the path to each file (including the file extension):
com.specmate.cerecognition.util.Configuration, variable
TRAINING_FILES
Set the variable AUTO_TRAIN to true and the algorithm will
attempt to read all training files and train the system with
the contained causality examples.

The format of .json training files has to comply the following:
[
	{
		"sentence": "This is a causal sentence example, because 
					it contains a causality.",
		"causality": {
			"cause": "it contains a causality",
			"effect": "This is a causal sentence example"
		}
	}, {
		"sentence": "This is a non-causal sentence example"
	}, ...
]

The log level can also be adapted in the Configuration. A log
level of 0 will show every log entry, a log level of 100 will 
only display fatal errors.
